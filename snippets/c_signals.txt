# signals are sent to a process (system environment) to manage the process
# signal notifications generally used to notify signal events that occured 

# common signal types (macros) 
  SIGINT (signal intertrupt like ctrl-c that immediately terminates process)
  SIGTSTP (signal suspends a process like ctrl-z)
  SIGABRT (signal immediately terminates a process) 
 
# examples of using signals to kill process via UNIX system 
  kill -<signal> <PID> 

# using C programming to mess with signals 
  #include <unistd.h> // standard unix functions 
  #include <sys/types.>  // various type definitions for system like pid_t
  #include <signal.h> // signal name macros and kill()

  pid_t my_pid = getpid();

  kill(mypid, SIGSTOP);

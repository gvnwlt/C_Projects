# static functions and variables (the poor man's private member or helper)
    -essentially this can be used in many different ways 
    -if used inside of a function the variable becomes a global on the heap (does not get destroyed after jumping out of the function's scope)
    -if used outside of a function for either variables or functions then it is basically a private member now that no other file can use

# char-star string (just a way to do strings in c since they are character arrays)
  char* string; 

# uses signal element at the end of the array to know that the string's end
  '\0' (null terminator) or '\n'

# free c functions that deal with strings (not very safe--overwrites and buffer
  overflows)
  strlen  (returns length of the string, iterates through array until \0) 
  strcpy  (copies string into another string)
  strcat  (glues two strins together)
